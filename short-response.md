# short response 
1.The first thing to do in collaboration that each person needs to create their own branch.
It's important because you can't both work in the main or in the same branch,so you must create your own.

2.Developers use branches to work on each tasks separetly without breaking the main project.

3.Git is a tool that keeps track of changes in your project.Github is cloud based website where you can store your repo.They work together by git manages versuins locally,and github lets you track,store,or even share them.

4.The sequence 
```
git commit -m "saving my work"
git add .
git push ```
is incorrect because it's adding changes after commiting,so commit doesnt include new changes.
The correct sequence is
```
git add .
git commit -m "saving my work"
git push 
```
